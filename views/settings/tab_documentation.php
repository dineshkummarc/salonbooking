<h3><em>Step 3</em></h3>
<strong>Go to “Salon Settings” - &gt; “Booking Rules” tab and provide the following information:</strong>

a) How many people you can attend during a single time-session?

You need to specify the number of people you can attend at the same time.

For example: if in your salon you are alone, this means that you can attend only one person during a single “time-session”. Meanwhile if in your salon you work with another person, this means that you can attend 2 persons during a single time-session.. and so on.

This setting is very crucial because it affects the number of online bookings that the plugin can accept for the same date/time.

b) You need to specify how many hours or days in advance users can book for an appointment. You need to set a minimum and a maximum time-range.

c) Set the duration of a single time-session.

The duration of a single time-session is the average length of your services. For example: if you are a barber your should decide how long on average lasts a single hair cut or a shave.
This setting affects the number of bookings allowed for the same  date/time.

d) You need to set your salon’s timetable specifying the days and the time range when the bookings are allowed.

Our plugin allows you to set multiple booking rules using “Add new” button.

e) “Disable online booking” is an option that you can use when you need to turn-off the online booking system. You can even set a custom message for your users.

f) “booking confirmation” option allows you to decide on single booking approval. On default settings this option is disabled. Every single booking is automatically approved by the system.

g) Set the “Thank you page”. A page where your users will be redirected after the booking process is completed. Use this page to provide further informations to your users.

b) Enable “pay later” option if you want to give users the option to pay once in your salon.

c) If you want to test PayPal payment you can enable the “PayPal Sandbox” mode. Remember to disable this option once you are ready to go live.

&nbsp;
